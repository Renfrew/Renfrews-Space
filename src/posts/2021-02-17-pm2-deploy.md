# Secure Expresss Back-end

## Environment

- Date: 2021 February

- AWS EC2: Ubunu 20.04.2 LTS

- PM2: v4.5.4

## Description

CI/CD using PM2 deploy for node application.

""Credit"": [CI/CD USING PM2 DEPLOY FOR NODE APPLICATION](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/ci-cd-using-pm2-deploy-for-node-application/)

## Development process

1. Develop your code on your local machine, and `git commit`

2. push to a git repository `git push`

3. run `pm2 deploy` on your local machine, and your app will up online on your server

## Prerequisites

- A remote host with `ssh` access

- A node app on a git repository such as on the GitHub

## Configuration

### Server Side

1. Install `PM2`

    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g

    // check the installation status
    pm2 -v
    ```

2. Create a SSH key. You can skip this step if you have a key.

    [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

    ```bash
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

    > Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519):[Press enter]

    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
    > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

    # start the ssh-agent in the background
    $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
    > Agent pid 59566

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

    ```

3. Add your key to your git repository server, such as GitHub

    > You should be able to `git clone <project>` without any interruption.
    >
    > If you are asked to enter keyphase, you may remove the keyphase from your SSH key by `ssh-keygen -p`

### Local Side

1. Install `PM2`

    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g

    // check the installation status
    pm2 -v
    ```

2. On the root directory of your project, run `pm2 ecosystem`. A file `ecosystem.config.js` will be added into your project.

    ```nodejs
    module.exports = {
        apps: [
            // put your apps here
            {
                // The name of your app
                name: "Renfrew's Space back-end",

                // the script to start
                // Such as 'yarn start' or just 'app.js'
                script: 'yarn start',

                // Watch the file changes
                watch: '.',
            },
        ],
        deploy: {
            // put your deploy methods here
            test: {
                // The user name you used to log into your server
                user: 'ubuntu',

                // The address of your server. It can be multiple server
                // host: ['1.2.3.4', '1.2.3.7', '1.2.3.9']
                host: 'www.example.com',

                // The SSH you used to log into your server
                key: '/Users/renfrew/.ssh/Renfrew-Space1.pem',

                // The address of your git repository
                repo: 'git@github.com:<your name>/<your project>.git',

                // The branch of your project
                ref: 'origin/main',

                // The path on your server that you want to store project
                // Make sure 'user' has permission to write without 'sudo'
                // You may use 'chown' command
                path: '/var/www/<project name>',

                // The command to run once the update is pulled down.
                'post-deploy': 'yarn build && sudo pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js',
            },
        },
    };
    ```
